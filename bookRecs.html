      <h2>Fablehaven by Brandon Mull</h2>
        <img class="hobby" src="img/fablehaven.JPG" alt="Fablehaven book cover">
        <p>This series is about a girl and her brother who go to their grandparents estate and find out it's a safehaven for magical creatures. I first read this series in middle school and it's been a comfort series ever since. Still a really fun read with twists that you would never expect.</p>

        <p>This series is about a girl who hunts the things that go bump in the night with her father. But what happens when her father comes back from a job... as a zombie?! Uh oh, it's a love triangle, but the monster lore is actually really good too.</p>
