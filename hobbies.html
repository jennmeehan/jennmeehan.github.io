    <h2>Reading</h2>
      <p>I really love to read. My favorite genres include fantasy, adventure, and romance. Reading allows me to escape from the real world. If you could choose to live in a world with dragons, would you?</p>
      <p>I have a list of book recommendations here if you want to check them out.</p>

    <h2>Sketching</h2>
      <p>I've been really into art ever since I was a kid. Sometimes It's hard to find the time to sit down and draw, but when you do, you can make some pretty amazing things</p>

    <h2>Knotting</h2>
     <p>Most people would call this making freidnship bracelets, but I have taken it further to bookmarks and keychains. It's really all about following patterns. It's quite tedious but once you get the hang of it, there's no stopping you.</p>
