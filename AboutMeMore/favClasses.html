    <h1>My Favorite Classes at CU</h1>

    <h2>Fairytales</h2>
      <p>I've taken several classes on italian and european fairytales taught by Susanne Magnanini. I've enjoyed every one of them. i think it's really interesting to learn where our stories come from.</p>

    <h2>Disney's Women and Girls</h2>
      <p>I am currently taking this class and it piggy backs off the last one. I get to analyze Disney movies and talk about Disney. I mean, my homework is to watch movies, how can that go wrong?</p>

    <h2>Pathway to Space</h2>
      <p>This is a requirement for the Space minor and hasd a lot of homework. But the professor came in everyday in a crazy suit/costume and made lecture into a talk show. Some days he would bring pizza and others he would throw candy into the audience. It was a very fun enviroment.</p>
